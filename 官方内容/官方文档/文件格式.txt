DirectDraw Surface (DDS)
DirectDraw Surface (DDS) is a container format for bitmap images, widely used for uncompressed or compressed textures in many games. BeamNG uses .dds for efficient texture streaming and rendering (e.g., normal maps, diffuse textures).

Portable Network Graphics (PNG)
PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is a lossless raster format suitable for interface icons, overlays, and textures where detail and transparency are important. BeamNG often uses .png for UI elements or smaller texture assets.

JavaScript (JS) Source Files
JavaScript (.js) scripts are used in various web-based or front-end contexts, such as the in-game UI built on web technologies. They may also appear in build tools, mods, or other workflow scripts.

JSON Data Files
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight text-based format used for structured data. BeamNG can use .json to store vehicle configurations, UI settings, performance metrics, or mod data.

Collada 3D Models (.dae)
Collada (COLLAborative Design Activity) is an open standard XML-based file format for 3D assets, developed by the Khronos Group. Learn more at Wikipedia: COLLADA .
In BeamNG, .dae files typically contain geometry, materials, and scene data. They can be processed into faster-loading .cdae (cached Collada) files for improved performance.

Torque3D Code
This is an obsolete scripting format. Please do not use or modify these files. Use Lua instead.

Lua Scripts
BeamNG uses Lua extensively for in-game scripting, logic, and scenario behavior. It’s the engine’s primary embedded scripting language for gameplay features and mod support.

HTML Documents
HTML files form the basis of BeamNG’s in-game UI framework, which uses web technologies for menus and overlays. They may also appear in documentation or custom mod user interfaces.

Ogg Vorbis Audio
Ogg Vorbis is a popular, open-source audio format used for background music, engine sounds, or ambient tracks. Its compression allows decent quality at smaller file sizes compared to uncompressed formats.

WAV Audio Files
WAV is a standard uncompressed audio container, often used in editing or engine sound banks, given its high fidelity. BeamNG might store short effect clips or high-quality source recordings as .wav.

Map Files
In the BeamNG context, .map files can refer to mission or level data, storing layout, entity placement, or environment configuration. They may also appear in mapping tools, holding various references for track or scenario design.

JPEG Image Files
JPEG images (.jpg or .jpeg) use lossy compression to reduce file size, making them popular for textures, UI backgrounds, or documentation images. Compared to .png, they’re more efficient for large photos but lack lossless transparency support.

SVG Vector Graphics
Scalable Vector Graphics (.svg) are XML-based vector images. They can scale without losing quality, making them ideal for icons, diagrams, or scalable UI elements. In BeamNG, .svg might be used in web-based UI or documentation.

Markdown Documents
Markdown files (.md) are lightweight text documents that use a simple syntax for formatting (headings, lists, etc.). They may be used for README files, in-game tutorials, or developer documentation.

Part Config Files
Part config files (.pc) define vehicle configurations and contain information such as paint colors, parts, and tuning parameters.

Flow Files
Flowgraph files (.flow.json) contain dynamic node based scripts that define gameplay logic.

Prefab Files
Prefab files (.prefab) bundle a group of assets together (vehicles, static objects, triggers, etc.) so that they can be loaded or unloaded at any time while a level is running. They can also be used as a template, allowing you to copy and paste a group of objects easily. Prefabs can be saved and loaded in two formats: .prefab, and .prefab.json. Currently, .prefab is recommended.

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
Cascading Style Sheets (.css) define visual styles for HTML interfaces. BeamNG’s UI system, built on web technologies, may use .css to style menus, scenario overlays, or mod UIs.

FLAC Audio Files
FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) is a high-quality audio compression format without losing detail. Though .ogg is more common for in-game assets, .flac might store master or high-fidelity sound files.

Vue Single-File Components
.vue single-file components are used in the Vue.js framework for web UIs. If BeamNG’s UI uses Vue, .vue files can contain HTML, CSS, and JS in one component file.

High-Level Shading Language (HLSL)
High-Level Shading Language (.hlsl) is Microsoft’s shader language for Direct3D. Such files may appear if BeamNG uses custom shaders for improved graphical effects.

Plain Text Files
.txt is a generic plain text format for logs, notes, or descriptors. BeamNG or mods might include simple textual data in .txt files.

SASS/SCSS Stylesheets
SASS/SCSS (.scss) is a superset of CSS providing variables, nesting, and more. Compiled to standard .css, it may appear in advanced BeamNG UI styles or dev tools.

TrueType Fonts
TrueType font files contain vector-based glyphs. .ttf is commonly used to display text in the game UI, ensuring consistent typeface usage in menus or overlays.

Pack/Archive Files
Pack or archive files (.pak) bundle multiple resources into a single container. They can be used to compress and distribute game assets or mod content in a simpler package.

YAML Files
YAML files (.yml or .yaml) are human-friendly, structured data formats. They can store configuration settings, environment variables, or other structured data in BeamNG.

Windows Dynamic Libraries
Dynamically Linked Libraries (.dll) contain compiled code on Windows. They might be used for external native modules, plugins, or custom engine features in BeamNG.

Python Scripts
.py files are Python scripts used for automation, data processing, or custom tooling. In a BeamNG workflow, they could generate data, manage builds, or provide mod management scripts.

OpenType Fonts
OpenType Fonts (.otf) are similar to .ttf but can contain advanced typographic features. They’re used to display custom or additional fonts within the BeamNG UI or for modded texts.

Audio Bank Files
Audio bank files (.bank) may store multiple sound assets or cues in a single container. They’re sometimes generated by audio middleware (like FMOD, Wwise) for use in the engine.

Windows Executables
Windows executable files (.exe) can be tools, installers, or external programs related to BeamNG. Mods rarely distribute .exe directly but dev tools might appear in the repository.

2D Sprite Atlases
2D sprite atlas files (.atlas) define sub-images (sprites) within a single texture. They can improve performance by reducing texture switching in UI or 2D game elements.

Log Files
Log files (.log) record diagnostic information, error messages, or execution traces. They help debug issues within BeamNG or monitor the game’s runtime behavior.

Terrain Data
Terrain files (.ter) can store heightmaps, ground textures, and terrain definitions. In BeamNG, they might be used by the terrain system for large-scale maps or off-road environments.

C/C++ Header Files
Header files (.h) declare C/C++ data structures, functions, or constants. They can appear in BeamNG’s native code or in external libraries that the game uses.

Functional Mock-up Units
Functional Mock-up Units (.fmu) are containers for dynamic system models (e.g., from Modelica). They may be employed in advanced physics simulations or external toolchains integrated with BeamNG.

Comma-Separated Values
Comma-Separated Values (.csv) is a text format storing table-like data. Data logs, performance metrics, or references can be handled easily in .csv with Excel or scripts.

Linux Shared Objects
Shared objects (.so) are dynamic libraries on Linux/Unix. They can provide platform-specific code or engine modules, though Windows .dll is more common in BeamNG.

GL Transmission Format Models
GL Transmission Format (.gltf) is a modern, JSON-based standard for 3D models, scenes, and animations. It can be used in workflows that require an open, efficient runtime format—though .dae is more common in BeamNG.

Static Libraries
Static libraries (.lib) contain compiled code to be linked into executables. They can appear in native code projects that interface with the BeamNG engine or its tooling.

Zip Archives
Zip archives (.zip) compress multiple files into one. They’re a common way to distribute mods, data, or packaged builds. BeamNG can load zipped mod archives from the “mods” folder.

Bitmap Images
Bitmap images (.bmp) store uncompressed pixel data. They’re less bandwidth-efficient but can appear in older mod assets or specialized tooling.

PDF Documents
Portable Document Format (.pdf) is used for documentation, manuals, or reference guides. Modders might include PDFs describing advanced setups or custom instructions.
