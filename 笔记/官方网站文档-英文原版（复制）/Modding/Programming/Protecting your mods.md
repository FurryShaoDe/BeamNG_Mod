### Picking a license

- For code, art, assets, etc **created entirely by you from scratch**, you may distribute them under whichever license(s) you prefer.

The license(s) will legally define how others can (or cannot) use and distribute your work, and it can better legally protect you from others too.

If you want to share your work freely with everyone, maybe you are considering releasing it into “Public Domain”. Please keep in mind that this concept does not legally exist in all jurisdictions, so it’s advisable that instead, you always **explicitly pick a license**.

### Respecting licenses

- For code, art, assets, etc **not created by you from scratch**, you **must** check their original licensing terms and comply with any possible laws affecting your use or redistribution of their assets.

This will **help distribute your mod**: if you submit your mod to the [official BeamNG mod repository](https://www.beamng.com/resources), **respecting licensing terms and any relevant laws** means we are able to consider it for inclusion.

You may want to use code, art, assets, etc from other mods, from other people in our community, from other communities, from other companies or brands, etc. If they do not offer licensing terms compatible with your goals, then you’ll need to either speak with them to get explicit permissions, or find and choose different assets which you can legally use.

### Example

A lot of official BeamNG source code is distributed under the [**open source** bCDDL](https://beamng.com/bCDDL-1.1.txt) license. If you want to copy-paste or modify any of our bCDDL source code and include it in your mod, then you can do so as long as you comply with the licensing terms of bCDDL.
